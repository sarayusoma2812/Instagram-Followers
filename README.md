By examining metrics such as follower count, post activity, average likes, and engagement rates over the past 60 days, we seek to understand user behavior and inform strategies for increasing fan base.

The dataset comprises data from the top 100 most followed Instagram accounts, including information on follower count, post activity, average likes, and engagement rates. Through data preparation, analysis, and visualization, we aim to uncover trends and correlations that can help influencers enhance their social media presence.
